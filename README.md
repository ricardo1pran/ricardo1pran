## About me
Iâ€™m an enthusiastic, friendly, highly motivated, result-oriented full-stack programmer that always do my best at work to meet and exceed standards and expectations.
Sometimes, programming is also about hobby. Other just-for-fun hobbies besides programming would be:
- Music arrangements (using Apple's GarageBand)
- Art (2D, manga/anime style) drawing, see my Pixiv URL
- Making memes (rarely)

### Professional projects

Due to privacy reasons (because I work in a bank!) I can't post the projects in my Github, but I work(ed) in projects that were built with these technologies:

- [![JavaSpringBoot][JavaSB]][JavaSB-url]
- [![dotNet5][NET5]][NET5-url]
- [![Angular][Angular.io]][Angular-url]
- [![React][React.js]][React-url]
- [![NextJS][Next.js]][Next-url]
- [![SQL Server][SqlServer]][SqlServer-url]

### Projects as a Hobby

Some of my repositories here were made as a hobby. Most of my hobbies are building apps using these technologies:

- [![Universal Windows App][Windows10]][Windows10-url]
- [![NextJS][Next.js]][Next-url]
- ![dotNetFW][NETFW]][NET5-url]
- [![HTML5][HTML]][HTML-url]
- [![JavaSpringBoot][JavaSB]][JavaSB-url]
