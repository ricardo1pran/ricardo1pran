## About me
Iâ€™m an enthusiastic, friendly, highly motivated, result-oriented full-stack programmer that always do my best at work to meet and exceed standards and expectations.
Sometimes, programming is also about hobby. Other hobbies besides programming would be:
- Music arrangements
- Art (2D, manga/anime style) drawing
- Making memes (rarely)

### Professional projects

Due to privacy reasons (because I work in a bank!) I can't post the projects in my Github, but I work in projects that were built with these technologies:

- [![JavaSpringBoot][JavaSB]][JavaSB-url]
- [![dotNet5][NET5]][NET5-url]
- [![Angular][Angular.io]][Angular-url]
- [![React][React.js]][React-url]
- [![NextJS][Next.js]][Next-url]
- SQL Server

### Projects as a Hobby

Some of my repositories here were made as a hobby. Most of my hobbies are building apps using these technologies:

- Universal Windows App (for my Lumia of course)
- NextJS
- HTML5
- Java Spring Boot API
